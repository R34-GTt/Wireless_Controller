<li>Introduction<br>
   This is microprocessor ESP32 based model railload wireless controller. <br>
   ESP32 is a microprocessor developed by Espressif Systems, with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, low cost, low power consumption, and other features.
Although there are many variations of the ESP32, we recommend using a development board that uses the ESP-WROOM-32D (e.g. ESP32-DevKitC-32D).
The ESP32-DevKitC-32D can be purchased on Ebay, Aliexpress, etc. starting at $4. At this time, purchase one with a built-in antenna (Fig. 1).<br>

  This controller are build by Parant unit and Child unit. Both unit includes ESP32 and are connected by Wifi.<br>

<li>Parent Unit<br>
   Parent unit is build by ESP32 and moterdriver mainly. Parent unit ESP32 programmed Arduino, wpowerp.ino.<br>
   You should modify Wifi-SSID and password at wpowerp.ino.<br>
   This is Parent unit schematic.
